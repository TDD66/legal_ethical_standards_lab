# Legal and Ethical Standards answers

## Scenario 1
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I believe it is illegal because the company are giving access to customers data without even getting permission from the customer. And GDPR requires consent in which customers have 'real choice and control' ([reference](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/consent/)).

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

The ethical concerns are that a bank who are responsible for finances are selling the information of potentially vulnerable customers to a loan shark that already has already garnered negative publicity.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

They can give customers the opportunity to opt out of the program by obtaining explicit consent.

## Scenario 2
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I don't believe their proposal breaks any laws.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

A concern is that historically introducing in-app purchases has lead to the exploitation of the players, who are now investing money into the game. This is even more concerning if the current player base is children.

Their can also be an impact on playing the game because in the past people would have had to complete the puzzles on their own but now they may feel pressured into buying a hint.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

Instead of selling things that have a direct impact on the gameplay experience they could monetise a different aspect of the application. Another idea is creating hints that are not too powerful and don't make the game too easy as this will make purchasing a hint less tempting.

## Scenario 3
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I don't believe this breaks any laws, a similar example that came to mind was something like LinkedIn with LinkedIn Premium.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

A big concern is the sharing of user's locations with the third party to create more targetting advertisments. It makes it more difficult for user's to know how their location data is being used and who has a hold off it. So it also reduces transparency.

The Free-tier users will feel as though they are having a lesser experience on the application compared to the paying users. This may compel them to buy a membership. This raises the concern of user exploitation.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

The company can reduce the number of features in the paid tier and put them back into the free tier. This would reduce the discrepancy between the experience the 2 different tiers will have.

They can also make it clearer as to which company will be using their location information for the targeted ads. This would improve transparency.
