# Legal and Ethical Standards answers

## Scenario 1
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I believe it is illegal because the company are giving access to customers data without even getting permission from the customer. And GDPR requires consent in which customers have 'real choice and control' ([reference](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/consent/)).

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

The ethical concerns are that a bank who are responsible for finances are selling the information of potentially vulnerable customers to a loan shark that already has already garnered negative publicity.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

They can give customers the opportunity to opt out of the program by obtaining explicit consent.
