# Legal and Ethical Standards answers

## Scenario 1
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I believe it is illegal because the company are giving access to customers data without even getting permission from the customer. And GDPR requires consent in which customers have 'real choice and control' ([reference](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/consent/)).

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

The ethical concerns are that a bank who are responsible for finances are selling the information of potentially vulnerable customers to a loan shark that already has already garnered negative publicity.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

They can give customers the opportunity to opt out of the program by obtaining explicit consent.

## Scenario 2
### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

I don't believe their proposal breaks any laws.

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

A concern is that historically introducing in-app purchases has lead to the exploitation of the players, who are now investing money into the game. This is even more concerning if the current player base is children.

Their can also be an impact on playing the game because in the past people would have had to complete the puzzles on their own but now they may feel pressured into buying a hint.

### What could the company do to address these issues?

Instead of selling things that have a direct impact on the gameplay experience they could monetise a different aspect of the application. Another idea is creating hints that are not too powerful and don't make the game too easy as this will make purchasing a hint less tempting.
